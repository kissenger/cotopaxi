# Cotopaxi
Project to develop a Strava-like platform to log completed distance of long-distance paths. <br>
This second generation is a ground up rewrite of Aconcagua implementing what I learned the first time around
The plan this time is to develop mature(ish) features deployed to the internet rather than a fully
featured but buggy experience that only works on my desktop.<br>
See the site live here: https://thetrailproject.co.uk/trailscape (NOT YET LIVE)<br>
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.


# List of dependencies
This time around I'm going to try and keep better track of my dependencies to avoid some of the mess I
got into last time when trying to develop on a different computer.<br>
